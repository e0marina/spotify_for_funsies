# spotify_for_funsies

This is an app built with create-react-app and uses Spotify's API. 

What it does / how to use: you can select a Genre of music ie. 'Hip-Hop'. Once you select that, you can select a sub-genre. Once selected and you hit Search, a playlist with song names will be displayed. If you click on one of the songs, you can see the album Art and name. 

The purpose of this app was to familiarize myself a little bit with Spotify's API. Future Development: make it have a cleaner and responsive design, this app focused on my learning and API's functionality. I might also refactore the code and change chaining of .then statements to Promise.all if it makes sense. Deployed app can be found: https://spotify-for-funsies.herokuapp.com/
